=== Context [[evaluate_in_context]]

There are times when you want to evaluate the contents of a function for confirmation.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn greet [s]
  ;; We'd like to evaluate the following code!
  (str "hello " s))
----

It is tired to bind arguments separately,
or to write function calls in the comment form every time.

[source,clojure]
----
(comment (def s "iced"))
;; or
(comment (greet "iced"))
----

This is where evaluating codes in context help you.
There is a default key bindings to evaluate code in a context.

.Default key mappings
[cols="30a,70"]
|===

| [reftext="evaluating outer list"]
[[evaluate_outer_list]]
outer list
| `{plug_iced_eval_in_context}`

With this mapping, the context input will be required.

The context is `clojure.core/let` style.
For example, the context `s "iced"` will be expanded to the following code.

[source,clojure]
----
(clojure.core/let [s "iced"]
  (str "hello " s))
----
