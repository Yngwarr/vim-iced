=== Results [[evaluation_results]]

The evaluation result is echoed on command-line and displayed in a popup at the end of line.
However, the displayed result is only the returned value, so for example, the contents output by `println` are not displayed.

The contents output to standard output are displayed on the <<stdout_buffer>>.

The highlight setting for popup can be modified by {help_html}#g%3Aiced%23eval%23popup_highlight[g:iced#eval#popup_highlight].
